A simple drop-in "replacement" for std::cout as logging facility but that logs
to a remove UDP server instead of (only) to the stdout.

WARNING:
    this is a lame C++ logging facility. You should probably use glog or
    something from boost. See: http://code.google.com/p/google-glog/ or
    http://torjo.com/log2/doc/html/index.html or http://www.boost.org

See remote_logging.hpp for documentation, main.cpp for a usage example.
